                Hi, I'm Divine, a creative and curious individual with 
                a passion for learning and exploring new ideas. I'm excited 
                to share my thoughts and connect with others!
                As someone who's drawn to the world of technology, 
                I'm constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow. 
                I'm passionate about coding, problem-solving, and collaborating 
                with others to bring innovative ideas to life. I'm looking forward to meeting new people,
                sharing experiences, and learning from others in this community
